# C# Programming Exercises for Beginners

These exercises are designed to help you practice basic concepts in C# programming, focusing on variables, data types, and control structures.

## Exercise 1: Address Information

Write a program that asks the user for their name, city, street, house number, and zip code. Store this information in appropriate variables and then display the complete address on the console.

## Exercise 2: Student Information

Create a program that captures student information. Ask for name, student ID, age, field of study, and university. Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information and display all information on the console afterward.

## Exercise 3: Number Formats

Write a program that reads a number in hexadecimal format (e.g., 0xFE), converts it to decimal format, and outputs it.

## Exercise 4: Boolean Variables

Create a program that reads a string, converts it to a boolean variable, and outputs "Yes" if the variable is true, and "No" if it is false.

## Exercise 5: Variable Swap

Declare two integer variables a and b and assign them the values 5 and 10. Then swap their values using a temporary variable. Output the values before and after the swap.

## Exercise 6: Triangle of Numbers

Write a program that takes a number and a width (also a number) as input. The program should then display a triangle with this width using the input number.

Example:

```
text
Input: Number = 6, Width = 6
Output:
666666
66666
6666
666
66
6
```

## Excercise 7: Different Data Types

Declare and initialize variables for the following information, choosing the most appropriate data type for each:

Your age
Your height in meters
The number of planets in the solar system
Whether you have programming experience
The first letter of your name
Your full name
Then output all values to the console.

## Exercise 8: Login System

Create a simple login system that takes a username and password as input (of type String). After 3 unsuccessful login attempts, the user should be rejected.

## Exercise 9: Number Pyramid

Write a program that reads a number n from the user and outputs a pyramid of numbers. The pyramid should have n rows, and in each row, the numbers should go from 1 to the current row number and then back to 1.

Example for n = 5:

```
1
121
12321
1234321
123454321
```

## Exercise 10: Letter Diamond

Write a program that reads a number n and outputs a diamond of letters. The diamond should have 2n-1 rows, with the middle row containing n letters. The letters should ascend starting from 'A'.

Example for n = 4:

```
    A
   ABA
  ABCBA
 ABCDCBA
  ABCBA
   ABA
    A
```

## Exercise 11: Spiral Numbers

Write a program that reads a number n and outputs an n√ón square with numbers in a spiral pattern. The spiral starts in the middle with 1 and spirals clockwise outward.

Example for n = 5 (if n is even, start just below and to the right of the middle):

```
17 16 15 14 13
18 5 4 3 12
19 6 1 2 11
20 7 8 9 10
21 22 23 24 25
```

## Exercise 12: Fibonacci Triangle

Write a program that reads a number n and outputs a triangle with n rows, where each number is the sum of the two numbers above it (Fibonacci principle).

Example for n = 6:

```
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
1 5 10 10 5 1
```
